                <p>We have been using Intelegencia as our DevOps vendor for our field service applications over the last couple of years and I’m extremely pleased with
                  their performance, ability to execute, and willingness to adapt in our ever changing environment. Perry is an outstanding leader who is fanatical about
                  customer satisfaction. He has built a solid team which has consistently delivered on projects thereby exceeding everyone’s expectations. </p>
